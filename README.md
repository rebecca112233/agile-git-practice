I thought this article gave a good overview of what the Internet of Things is, and presented realistic problems with it. A few of the concerns that I thought were interesting were the ones about privacy and security and data surge. If everything is connected to the web, it raises concerns about privacy and our data. Today, we already see a lot of data breaches when it comes to the information that we put up on social media sites, or dating apps; what would happen if all of our data, even how toasted we like our bread, is breached? This new influx of information would also lead to issues with where to store the data. At the moment, comanies aren't ready to store the amount of data that would be collected on a day to day basis.

A decade ago, people had to use walkmans and over-the-head earphones to listen to music and they could only listen to one cassette at a time, which held about 45 minutes worth of music per side. To listen to a song again, you would have to rewind the tape and then play it again. Now, we can easily listen to thousands of songs from all over the world just by saying "Alexa, play *Eye of the Tiger*." 

The Internet of things has truly revolutionized the way we live and I'm amazed that tech has come so far. Of course, there are many barriers to the advancement of IoT but it's been growing so exponentially that I wouldn't be surprised if those hurdles are quickly overcome.
